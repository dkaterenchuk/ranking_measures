"""ranking_measures.measures: a rank-ordering evaluation package for Python
=========================================================================

ranking_eval is a set of common ranking algorithms such as:
*dcg
*ndcg
*precision
*precision_k
*average_precision
*rankdcg

rankdcg is a new measure and it is described in this paper:
